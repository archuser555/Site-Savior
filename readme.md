# German SS Beta 0.1v :)
just kidding, well this is just a small tool i've made to control my linux server with my phone, so i don't need to access my computer, it's secure of course, i won't make something insecure, that's my 1# rule in life, jk anyways i host a website in my personal computer, if you are serious about security, check the codebase, you can access the app from phone via your ip, and maybe gonna add an option to setup domain later? here is some of it's features:

- work anywhere in the world *i guess*
- support linux only
- secure asf
- allow you to view database and edit it
- allow you to run commands on the machine
- pure rust

contribution are welcome, btw SS is an abbreviation for SiteSavior, a random word spawned in my head when writing this in neovim :) contribe now!! i love you ‚ù§Ô∏è

im working right now on the following features:

- computer statistics, information and like ram, disk usage, etc...
- vnc connection, so you can controle the computer from phone!
- buttons to help you controle the server status, shutdown, restart, etc...
- lanch SQL queries on the db, im planing to support postgres & mysql & SurrealDB

that's it, hope you know some rust and can fix my errors, good luck & you dropped this üëë
